# betterdoctors

API used: BetterDoctor https://betterdoctor.com/partners/
Main library used: jquery
This is a web application that allows users to browse through a preconfigured or filtered (by specialty) list of doctors.
Upon selecting a doctor, more information on the doctor, along with a list of similar doctors, is provided.
The "similarity" is determined by the doctors' specialties and practices.
The similar doctors are sorted using 'best match' algoritm provided by the betterdoctors API

Assumptions made:
assumes user wants doctors located at 37.773,-122.413

Hours spent thus far: 4

Future Improvements: 
Performance: I believe the over-usage of jquery is the reason for the poor performance.
Give users the option to select on similar doctors.
  Add another modal popup when users select similar doctors
Visuals: Add background image, change the look of buttons and drop down menu, add more animations and visual appeal
Remove location assumption by asking users for their location
